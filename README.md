# WordPress - Product license E-commerce

This is an experimental WordPress App that comsumes data from an external API [https://next-auth-test-beige.vercel.app/](https://next-auth-test-beige.vercel.app/) and renders it on the custom inowex-ecommerce theme based on TwentyTwentyFour.
It's based on PHP, SCSS, HTML, jQuery and JavaScript.

Plugins: Contact Form 7 and Stripe

Stripe has been integrated to Contact Form 7 so it can process test payments and store them into Contact Form 7 logs.

## Todo
